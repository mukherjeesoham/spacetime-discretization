# Things to do
    > Solve for the conformally compactified spacetime. 
    > Extent the tiled code to 4D. Note that one can no longer use diamond shaped patches. 
    Need to use some kind of space-filling simplices.
    > Port the code to Haskell.
    > Solve for a time-dependent (localized in time and space) potential.
    > Issues one needs to think about
        > Compactification of inifities
            > Can we use conformal compactification, or use a conformally 'dual' mapping
            to handle infinity on the grid?
        > Imposing boundary conditions
            > How do we treat the boundaries in 2+1, or even 3+1? They are no longer just lines.
        > Simplices
            > What data structure do we use for storing the points on complex simplices? 
            > We need to store the orientation and the values at the points. Can Pachner moves help?
        > Solve for a scalar wave test particle on a background? No conservation of charge like the EM case?
